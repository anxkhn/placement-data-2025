## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

Finding transparent, recent, and comprehensive placement data in India's tech sector has been challenging. Most available datasets are either:

- Outdated (from 2022 or earlier)
- Fragmented across multiple sources
- Lacking compensation details
- Not publicly accessible

This repository aims to bridge that gap by providing a centralized, regularly updated resource for students preparing for placements and internships.
